Welcome to the Operational Land Use and Transport Microsimulation (OLUTM) Model. Here you will find all the associated codes, tools, and documents to perform sub-models of the OLUTM model. 

Files (1-3) correspond to baseline data and travel simulation outcomes. File (4) gathers the data collected for the Employment Distribution model. File (5 and 7) are necessary data inputs for File 6; the Employment Allocation Model. The Household Allocation Model requires the use of raw data in File 7 and File 1. The decision-making process for the Household Allocation model and the Employment Allocation model is based on the Monte Carlo instrument in File 8. Lastly, Land use change sampling and the maximized model utilize data from our synthetic dataset (File 2). All the information is based on several input requirements for an integrated land use and transport microsimulation model. The information within corresponds to the data sample collected on-site in September 2019 (File 1). Input datasets are openly available through the local government of Indonesia, cited on the manuscript. 

#Steps to Reproduce Modeling Efforts
(1) Gather a minimum of 26 household interviews by surveying a target population as baseline data. 
(2) Prepare the data by making a synthetic dataset statistically equivalent to the data sample. 
(3) Cluster households of the population with: 
  (3.1) the household composition proportional to the data sample with a number of adults per household, either 1;2; or 3 [File 1];     (3.2) All households of a cluster must have their occupational profile and their household composition represented within a Land       Use State in [File 2-tab 2]; and, 
  (3.3) find a lifestyle segmentation system suitable for developing countries (www.arellano.com.pe) or developed countries (Vals)       and cluster individuals proportional to the number of segments in the data sample. 
(4) Form the clusters manually, or preferably using a computational programming script to form synthetic clusters proportional to the data sample. 
(5) Follow Chapter 5, sub-section 5.3 of the associated article to carry out empirical analyses.
